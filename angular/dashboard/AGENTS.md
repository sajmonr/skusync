# Angular Dashboard Development Standards

These instructions apply to all work under `angular/dashboard/`.

## Architecture

Organize application code by business feature. Do not create application-wide folders that group
unrelated code only by technical type, such as a root `components/`, `services/`, or `models/`
folder.

```text
src/app/
├── core/       # Application-wide infrastructure and transport contracts
├── features/   # Business capabilities and routed pages
├── layout/     # Application shell, navigation, sidebar, and topbar
├── shared/     # Domain-neutral reusable UI and utilities
├── app.config.ts
├── app.routes.ts
└── app.ts
```

Dependencies flow toward shared infrastructure:

```text
features ──> shared
    │          │
    └────────> core

layout ─────> shared/core
core ───────> no features
shared ─────> no features
```

- A feature must not import another feature's internal files.
- `core` and `shared` must never import from `features`.
- Keep code in its owning feature first. Move it to `shared` only after at least two unrelated
  features need it and it contains no domain-specific behavior or vocabulary.
- Avoid broad `index.ts` barrel files. Prefer direct imports so dependencies remain visible.

## Feature Structure

Create only the folders a feature actually needs:

```text
features/product-variants/
├── pages/                 # Routed orchestration components
├── components/            # Feature-specific presentation components
├── data-access/           # HTTP clients and feature state
├── models/                # API DTOs and feature view models
├── utilities/             # Pure feature-specific functions
└── product-variants.routes.ts
```

- Page components coordinate route state, data loading, and user actions.
- Feature components may understand domain concepts but should not make HTTP calls.
- API DTOs stay with the consuming feature unless they are genuinely cross-feature transport
  contracts.
- Keep editable form models separate from API DTOs when their shapes diverge.
- Lazy-load top-level features from `app.routes.ts`.

## Components

- Use standalone components. Angular v22 uses `OnPush` by default, so do not add an explicit
  `changeDetection` setting unless intentionally opting into `ChangeDetectionStrategy.Eager` or
  `ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default` for an exceptional case.
- The application is zoneless by default. Do not add ZoneJS or `provideZoneChangeDetection()`.
  Ensure template updates are scheduled through signals, changed inputs, template listeners,
  `AsyncPipe`, or an explicit `markForCheck()` notification.
- Prefer signal inputs, signal outputs, computed signals, and local signals for new code.
- Keep a component's TypeScript, template, stylesheet, and tests together.
- Use page components for orchestration and keep reusable UI components presentational.
- Keep HTTP calls and feature state out of shared UI components.
- Do not wrap every PrimeNG component. Add a wrapper only when it enforces a recurring application
  convention or supplies meaningful behavior.
- Use PrimeNG v22 APIs and documentation from <https://primeng.dev/>.
- Preserve accessible labels, keyboard operation, focus visibility, and semantic HTML.

## Services and State

- Put application-wide infrastructure in `core`, including API configuration, interceptors,
  authentication, logging, notifications, and global error handling.
- Put feature-specific services in `features/<feature>/data-access`.
- Name services by responsibility. Examples: `ProductVariantsApiService`,
  `ProductVariantsStore`, and `NotificationService`.
- API services perform HTTP requests and transport mapping. Stores coordinate feature state,
  loading status, query options, and actions.
- Use root provision only for intentionally application-wide singleton services. Provide feature
  state at the route or page level when its lifetime should match that feature.
- Do not introduce a generic HTTP wrapper over `HttpClient`; feature API services should use
  `HttpClient` directly while shared interceptors handle cross-cutting transport concerns.
- Use a plain function instead of an injectable service for stateless transformations that have no
  dependencies.

## Pipes, Directives, and Utilities

- Pipes are small, pure display transformations. Do not use pipes for server-backed filtering,
  ordering, paging, API work, or complex business decisions.
- Keep domain-specific pipes and directives in their feature. Put only domain-neutral ones in
  `shared/pipes` or `shared/directives`.
- Utilities must be pure functions. Avoid miscellaneous `helpers` or `utils` dumping grounds;
  name files for the operation they provide.
- Product table filtering, ordering, and paging remain server-driven through the standardized API
  query contract rather than transforming complete collections in the browser.

## HTTP Contracts

- Keep shared transport types such as `ProblemDetails` and `PagedResponse<T>` in `core/api`.
- Keep endpoint-specific request and response DTOs inside the owning feature.
- Successful endpoints return their documented DTO directly; do not expect a universal success
  envelope.
- Errors use Problem Details. Validation errors extend Problem Details with an `errors` dictionary.
- HTTP interceptors handle transport-wide concerns only. Feature-specific error interpretation
  belongs in feature data-access or orchestration code.

## Testing and Naming

- Co-locate unit tests as `*.spec.ts` beside the code under test.
- Test observable behavior rather than private implementation details.
- Use kebab-case filenames that match the responsibility of the exported symbol.
- Use explicit suffixes when they communicate architectural responsibility, such as `-page`,
  `-api.service`, `-store`, or `.routes`.
- Run `npm test -- --watch=false` and `npm run build` before completing Angular changes.
